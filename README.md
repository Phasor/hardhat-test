The deploy scripts in /scripts show a mix of using raw ethers (deployTestEthers.js) and using the HardHat Runtime Environment version of ethers (deployTest.js).

Execute the HRE deploy script with:
`npx hardhat run deployTest.js --network goerli`

Execute raw ethers deploy script with:
`node deployTestEthers.js`
